This is the complete sample code for the
[Quick Start Guide for iOS APS SDK](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Quick_Start_Guide_for_iOS_APS_SDK).

Before running this sample, drag the `Appcelerator.framework` folder to the `Frameworks` folder in Xcode.

In the `AppDelegate.m` file, replace the `APS_APP_KEY` variable with your APS application key.

You should now be able to build the project.
